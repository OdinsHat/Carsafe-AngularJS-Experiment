Carsafe AngularJS Experiment
============================

An experiment in [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) that uses the 
[NHTSA API](http://www.nhtsa.gov/webapi/Default.aspx?Recalls/API/83) to 
get car safety data.

The API requires a **Year**, **Make** and **Model** before giving the 
car safety data you request.

Current obstacles to overcome (also see issues):

* When **Year** selected in drop down make it populate the **Makes** dropdown.
* As above but with **Models**

I have the feeling the above could be fundamental misunderstandings of how 
Angular works so I'll look into some of the other resources recommended:

* [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/)
* [thinkster.io](http://www.thinkster.io/)
* [Angular Developer Guide](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide)
* [Angular API](https://docs.angularjs.org/api)
